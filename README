This is a simple tool to handle rolling dice with a variety of special
rules.

It is useable online, as an offline web app, and as a mobile app.

To use, navigate to roll.html with a web browser. It must have
roll.js, roll.js, and jquery.min.js in the same directory.

As time goes on, more features will be added, including difference
dice systems, and more customizability within given dice systems.

The program's logic is written in JavaScript, and is primarily
contained in roll.js
